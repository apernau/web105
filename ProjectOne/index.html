        <h2>about me</h2>
        <img src="../ProjectOne/images/AshleyP.JPG" alt="AshleyP"> 
        <p>I am 34 years young and am currently living in McHenry. I have four kids, ages 8, 7, 3, and 2, with my
            my partner, Eddie. We will celebrate ten years together this upcoming Christmas. I grew up in the city
        of Chicago, more specifically, the Northwest Side. I am a city girl at heart, and although I do miss all of 
        the eclectic and diverse food, I certainly do not miss living in the city. McHenry has been my home for about 6 years 
        now and I am loving the area! The nightlife reminds me of living in the city but you still get the suburban feel too, which
        makes it feel cozy. It's really the best of both worlds.</p>
        <p>Honestly, I am pretty much a big kid at heart. I love reading, crossword puzzles, board/card games, watching
            tv/movies (especially Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc.), pilates, and hanging out with my family.
            I also love crafting, antiquing, and rummaging through garage sales/thrift stores. There are so many lost treasures at
            those places!</p>
