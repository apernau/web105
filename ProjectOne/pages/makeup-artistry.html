            <h3>Makeup Artistry is my all-time favorite thing to do. I love playing with the different
                types of makeup mediums that this generation has to offer. It is absolutely refreshing to be able to
                walk around everyday expressing my creativity in ways I only dreamed about as a little girl.
                Playing with makeup has given me more confidence and freedom than I could have ever hoped for.
                I love coming up with crazy, colorful looks and challenging the walls of femininity with each 
                application. The looks above are just a few of the plethora of looks I have come up with
                in my lifetime. I would love to build a portfolio one day to remind myself just how far I've come.
