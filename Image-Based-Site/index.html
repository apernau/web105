        <p>Growing up in Chicago has a way of altering your personality. 
            You grow up loving all kinds of eclectic foods and learning about different cultures 
            all within your neighborhood. I loved having the opportunity to learn about new things 
            all within minutes of my childhood home. Chicago was a mecca for various ethnicities, 
            religions, cultures, backgrounds, and more. It was eye-opening to be able to take all of 
            it in starting at a young age, and it has molded me into the person I am today.</p>
        <p>As a kid, I did not grow up lavishly. My family was middle working class, and we struggled 
            from time to time just affording necessities. Growing up in a simple-minded home comes with 
            its own challenges, but those challenges have helped me stay humble. I learned how to be 
            self-sufficient at a very early age, and immediately took to building a stable and reliable 
            work ethic around it. I started work early in my teens at a neighborhood youth center, which 
            impacted the person I am today. It grounded me into a determined and motivated individual with 
            the never-ending ability to adapt to whatever the circumstance provided me. I can say that I would 
            not have the work ethic I have today without this place giving me the steppingstones to reach my full 
            potential.</p>
        <p>My work history had only begun to blossom from there. I bounced around to different jobs, learning 
            everything I could along the way. I have worked in retail, the food service industry, childcare, 
            non-profit organizations, different trades, and more. I have been able to grow my wealth of knowledge 
            from these various positions and have molded that into what I would consider a fortune of real-life 
            experience. I guess I am really a “jack of all trades”, so to speak.</p>
