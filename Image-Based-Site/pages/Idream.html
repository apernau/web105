        <p>..daydream..</p>
        <p>“As I sit among the flowers planted in the fields, 
            I can’t help but to wonder what it endured for these seeds to flourish. 
            Looking back at my own life, I also can’t help but to wonder what I have endured
            for my own seeds to flourish in my field.”</p>
        <p>I loved writing when I was younger; It helped provide some solace in times where I felt alone or unheard. 
            It gave me purpose and helped me cope with things that impacted my life. It gave me a voice when I felt voiceless, 
            and a strength when I felt most powerless, because I knew that no one could take my words from me. This poem I wrote 
            when I went through my first heartbreak helped me heal in ways I had never known about before, and helped me see that my life, 
            although devastating at times, would always be beautiful to me.</p>
        <p>“when you're young, love is only real in movies and music, you never realize its full effect on people-it doesn't seem true. 
            It only seems like a story people tell. The emotions only seem like a fantasy. You listen to music about love and never fully 
            understand the words or their meaning. As you get older, you learn what love is, but still you have no clue. You're lost, walking 
            aimlessly in a world full of uncertainties, until you meet that one person. You weren't expecting anything. You've stopped dead in your tracks. 
            Everythings changed. All of a sudden everything seems to make sense, like everything is finally falling into place, like everything that came 
            before then was so miniscule, so meaningless. This person completely engulfs you, changes your entire life. All of a sudden all those movies 
            begin to make sense, the emotions are no longer a fantasy, they are your reality. The music begins to define everything you thought you could 
            never feel, all the words seem to become your own. This person makes you feel like you're floating, up in the air, no strings attached. Love 
            has become the only emotion you feel, the only thing you know. Its amazing and you wonder why you were never able to feel it before, why noone 
            has ever been able to make you feel it before. You're not lost anymore, you've been found. His smile lifts you up and his kiss helps keep you 
            grounded. His smell is intoxicating, his laugh is a head rush. His heartbeat and yours have become one. One look and you melt. You become 
            butter in his arms. You don't know how you've ever lived without him and know that you can never live without him again......but then 
            everything changes, that feeling begins to fade, you've become lost again. Nothing feels right anymore. You've become unsure of everything. 
            All those movies were lies, and those love songs hurt to hear. You were once living but now you feel like you're dying. You're broken and 
            you don't know how to get fixed. Your heart that was once full is now empty,  punctured with wound holes. Nothing makes sense anymore, you 
            doubt that anything was ever real and you cry because you never thought you'd lose that feeling. But you don't regret it. You don't know 
            why, but you don't regret it. It was amazing once, you know love is real and that its possible. You're not in the dark, but you're not in 
            the light either. You're walking alone again, but not aimlessly, you have a purpose, to become stronger. Everything takes time, and yes 
            you may be lonely and you may be hurting, but love is amazing and people find it everyday. Don't cry because its over, smile because it happened.”</p>
