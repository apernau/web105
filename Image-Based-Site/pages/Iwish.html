        <p>Wishes</p>
        <p>Wishes are the hearts dreams. My wishes are pretty simple. Health, Wealth, and Happiness. 
            These are the three things I always wish for on any birthday, wishing star, 11:11 time, 
            or any time it calls for a wish. </p>
        <p>For obvious reasons, health is first. Always. If you don’t have your health, you don’t 
            have anything. I always wish for, not just mine, but the health and well-being of all 
            the important people in my life, because that is what they deserve-health. Long, healthy lives together. 
            All of us, being healthy and together.</p>
        <p>Second is wealth, and while yes, financial wealth is an obvious WISH, in my case this is not the wealth 
            I wish for. I wish for the wealth of a great and fulfilling life. Having those who truly love and care 
            for me with me for as long as possible. It is also having the wealth of knowledge, because to me that 
            is the true wealth. Money is cool, but money only gets you so far. Money comes and goes, but being self-aware, 
            knowledgeable, truthful, honest, kind, etc., these are all things that mean wealth to me. </p>
        <p>Lastly, is happiness. Pretty straightforward. Happiness is an ideal I believe everyone strives towards, 
            but only little achieve. Happiness is hard to come by these days. It takes a lot of mental strength and 
            confidence to be happy (of course this is for me, personally). I have been dealing with my own personal 
            struggles that have made me question what true happiness is, for me. It takes more energy to be happy than 
            to be sad. For me, its finding reasons to be happy these days that make me sad. I am an overthinker who always
             jumps to the worst possible scenario in every situation. I am learning to be honest about my struggles and have 
             been trying hard to find the little things in life that bring me joy to remind me what it really is that life is 
             about. The simple things. The people around you. The fact that you woke up breathing today is already a fantastic 
             thing to be happy and grateful for.</p>
