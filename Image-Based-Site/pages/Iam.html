        <p>Who Am I?</p>
        <p>I Am AshleyRae. 34 years old with four children, Izzy, Izaac, Ezra, and Zoe. I have lived in McHenry for 6 six years. 
            I grew up in the city of Chicago, Illinois, near Northcenter. 
            I attended Lane Tech High School and was fortunate enough to work at some interesting and unique places.
            I worked ever since I was 13 and was able to build an extensive resume working under different positions in my teens. Some places I've
            worked at include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ironworkers Union - Machinery Movers, Riggers, and Erectors Local 136</li>
                <li>City Year Chicago</li>
                <li>Wrigley Field</li>
                <li>Go Roma Italian Restaurant</li>
                <li>NBGC - Neighborhood Boys and Girls Club</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As I got older, I moved around to different suburbs, getting a grasp on the different areas around Chicago. 
                I lived in Oak Park for several years while attending Triton College in River Grove. 
                I was able to take several credit hours in the Graphic Design program, which started my love for computer arts.
             After taking some time off from school in 2010, I began working full-time after my childhood home was sold and my immediate family moved out of state. 
             I was determined to build my life around my childhood city, and looked for work wherever I was able.</p>
             <p> In 2013, I was working four part time jobs and constantly keeping myself busy. 
                I joined the Ironworkers Union (Local 136) in late 2013 and met my current fiancé in the apprenticeship program. 
                While learning a new trade was fun, it wasn’t my ideal job, and I left to find something I had more passion for. 
                Shortly after leaving the union, I found out I was pregnant with my daughter and my whole life shifted. 
                I found a part time job working for a chocolate store and when my daughter was born, I took time off to stay home with her. </p>
            <p>Presently, I am taking part-time online college classes for an Associates In Applied Sciences Degree with a focus in Network Security. 
                I graduate in Spring of 2024 and am hoping to find a job in my field shortly after. I currently am working part-time as a server while maintaining my household. 
                It is busy but I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
