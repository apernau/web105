        <p>Love is...</p>
        <p>Indescribable. 
            It has been defined repeatedly by many, through highs and lows and everything in between. 
            The good, bad, and ugly. Love is unpredictable. It comes with no warnings and makes you 
            question everything that had come beforehand. If we are lucky, we get to feel love at 
            least once in our lives.</p>
        <p>For me, love is unfathomable. It makes you completely throw every inhibition out the window. 
            It gives you so much LIFE.</p>
        <p>Love is my family. My kids. My world. These things mean everything to me. I never knew what 
            true love was until I had my kids. There is no greater feeling in the world than looking at 
            this little, tiny person you created and knowing that they’re there because of YOUR love. 
            It truly is amazing. It gives you this overwhelming feeling of strength while at the same 
            time making you feel completely powerless because it can be taken from you at any given moment. 
            Life is unfair, and love does not play by the rules. I love being their mom. It is the best job 
            I have ever had in my entire life.</p>
        <p>Love is also a plethora of things that bring you joy. 
            Something that makes you undoubtedly happy. For me, other than my children, those things are my passions. 
            Art, Design, Makeup Artistry, Crafting, Crosswords, and so much more. I have devoted so much time to finding 
            the things that bring me joy and hanging onto them for dear life. If it brings you joy, you need to hang on 
            to those things. Sometimes it’s those little bits of joy that are all you have. At the end of the day, you 
            come into this world alone and you leave it the same way. So, for me, love is one of those things that I make 
            sure to give my all to when I have it because it’s never guaranteed.</p>
