<h2>Main Characters</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
<p><b>Sarah</b> is the main protagonist, and while young and naïve, she is faced with the harsh consequences of her actions when she accidentally mutters the phrase that gets her brother taken. <br> 
   <b>Hoggle</b> is Sarah’s first encounter with someone from the Goblin City. 
    He is grouchy and irritable from the start, but with Sarah’s constant persistence and helplessness, Hoggle becomes a friend and an ally in her attempt to save her brother. 
    Hoggle, while cowardly and fearful of Jareth, is able to set aside his fears in order to help save his new friend and her brother from Jareth’s dark grips.<br>
    <b>Jareth</b> is the Goblin King and the main antagonist. He sits atop a throne in his castle that is located beyond the Goblin City and deep within the labyrinth. 
    He boasts love and eternal life to Sarah if she gives him her baby brother in return. His mad and ingenious attempts to trick Sarah and run out her time to save 
    her brother emphasize his lust for power.<br>
    Ludo is a beast Sarah saves from torture, and he ends up helping Sarah in her quest to solve the labyrinth. 
    He has magical powers in his roar, and when he does, he can call rocks and boulders to aid when needed (which proves to be very useful). 
    <b>Ludo</b> becomes one of Sarah’s allies early on and even attempts to save her from the hallucinations of Jareth.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><em>Labryinth</em> is a mystical tale that emphasizes the importance of family, friends, and confidence/strength in one’s own self. 
    Each one of Sarah’s friends that she makes along the way in the labryinth are all symbolic of the characteristics that Sarah lacks (or sometimes has too much of) in the beginning of the film. 
    Hoggle represents Sarah’s selfishness and naivety in the beginning, which she realizes as she makes her way through the labyrinth. She is shown to have a false egotistical personality where the only feelings that matter are her own. 
    Along the way, Hoggle helps Sarah see that her selfishness has impacted the relationship she has with her father, stepmother, and new baby brother. Ludo represents Sarah’s lack of kindness, which she shows when she is forced to babysit her brother as her parents are out for the night. 
    She is rude and mean and careless, even getting frustrated and mad at her brother when she realizes that one of her stuffed animals is gone (which is presumed he was given by the parents when she was out earlier in the day). 
    She proceeds to treat him with resentment and even wishes him to be taken by the Goblin King, not knowing that her actions will lead to him actually being taken. Ludo, while unable to effectively communicate with Sarah (even seems to speak in small words like a child), shows Sarah that all creatures, great and small, deserve kindness and help when they are unable to help themselves. 
    Jareth represents everything that Sarah was, mean, selfish, egotistical maniac with intentions to only do what benefits him and his kingdom. Sarah soon sees the reflection of herself in him, leading her to change, mature, and really see what is important in her life, the exact things she took for granted. </p>
    <h4>Jareth's Last Attempt</h4>
